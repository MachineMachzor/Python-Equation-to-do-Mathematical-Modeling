This is a script that allows you to predict future data with an equation of your choice. Some of the links I used to create this (if you're interested in recreating it) is listed below the instructions



HOW TO IMPLEMENT YOUR OWN FUNCTION ON CUSTOM DATA

1. Import a new csv file with new data. It can have a header row with columns, and change the bacteriaCsvFile variable
2. Change the logFunc to be your own logFunc
3. Print the equation under modeledLogEquation to see the new equation (change the b and k variables/add new ones to print the full function)
4. Change modeledLogEquation with the new parameters 
5. Add new custom data for the variable newArea1D to test it on new data 
6. Profit
